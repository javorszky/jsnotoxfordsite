ðŸ¤Ÿ This month, we've got

- [Marcus](https://twitter.com/Marcus_Noble_) here to tell us everything about Kubernetes
- [Ryan](https://twitter.com/spikeheap) telling us _a bit_ about Coaching

Marcus [tweeted about what he's thinking of covering](https://twitter.com/Marcus_Noble_/status/1356600550230548481), so feel free to reach out to him and ask him any specific questions! Or drop into the [#jsoxford slack](https://digitaloxford.slack.com/archives/C0UURPG9H/p1612466756040900) to find out more.

Ryan is helping run a [Introduction to coaching](https://ti.to/slate-horse/introduction-to-coaching-feb-2021) on Friday. Really worth attending!
